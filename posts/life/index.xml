      <description>I felt so energetic today. I have to admit that I didn&#39;t not work today. After today&#39;s daily meeting, my colleague A chatted me that he was still busy setting up his new laptop but he would let me know when he finished so he could give me the new task. In addition, I checked the master branch too, it hasn&#39;t been updated by O yet. Okay I was kind of free today.
