Ich bin erschöft heute, da arbeitete ich ganz Tag 8 Stunden im Büro. 
Am Morgen met ich eine Kolligin N von mir in Frankfurt Hbf. 

I\'m exhausted today because I did work 8 hours in office today. During this 8 hours, I attended 3 meetings, contacted with 7 colleagues(online and offline, working and eating). I was CC for 14 times! But the real number of the Emails that I needed to check is only 4. I can tell my colleagues had a busy day today, since today is kind of important for release preparation but some of responsible persons are on holiday this month. There was one email literally saying(based on my understanding), come on someone please check this issue, the team we are cooperating is hard to handle... 

My weekly routine on my offline workday is always eatting a toast as breakingfast at McDonald. However I ate Müsli with milk at home today. Unexpectedly I met one of my colleague N when I was on my way to office in Frankfurt Hbf. I was hesitated to say hello to her since I don\'t have so much contact with her at work. But I still caught up with her and talked a bit, asked how was her apartment hunting as she mentioned it last time during our lunchtime together. Later on our way to the building we met another colleague of us, O, grabbing a cup of coffee in his hand. O is my first technical mentor in the company, he guided my with my first task. As he was talking about his TÜV examination we arrived at our building. 

G gave me my last task about sql. I haven\'t figured out how to export large number from dataframe to excel in normal number form. They have changed into scientific notation in excel automatically. He suggested me to add one more column as text format. Then he will have a two-weeks holiday to New Swanstone Castle. Therefore I need to turn to another colleague A for my next task. A will talk to me on Thurday. A is a frontend developer, I guess my task will have something to do with frontend again but maybe in java I'm not so sure.

My first thing to do in the morning was running the regressiontest so my other colleagues can discuss the result in the afternoon. I was kind of proud of myself that I made some small achievements. But it turned out that there were some duplicated results due to data source code, which I need to check tomorrow again. First I will wait for my colleague O to update the master branch and create a new feature branch for me. Then I will add or delete some datasource code. All in all, the result of test was fine. 

I ate with 5 colleagues today at kasino. (The website of our menu for kasino had been 404 for a long time!) We talked about holiday plan, Ferienhaus and driver license. What did they prepare for the holiday, like bikes, wander shoes, blabla... I was focus on eating bcs I usually was the last one to finish my food but today I was not.
