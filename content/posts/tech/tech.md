# Background/Motivation
I have attended the kickoff course of IVAR in 2022. It was the most interesting lecture I have ever attended. But I didn't have any experience about unity at that time so I was thinking I could attend this course next year after I got some experience with unity. However, I still didn't try to learn unity. So here I am. There are two purposes of taking this course: 
1. following the course schedule sysmatically to finish a project 
2. find an interesting topic for my master thesis. 

The goal of the course is to create locomotion technique and implement interaction task in a parkour map in XR environment with meta quest.

# The Idea
After the first lecture every attendee was required to write a short motivation email to the tutor. Because the number of equiments is limited, the number of students who can attend this lecture is also limited. 

I was thinking about all the different sports I have tried before, such as bouldering, rowing, shooting. But later I decided to implement skateboarding experience. The reasons are as follows: 
1. the people without skateboarding experience before can try to skateboard as well. 
2. people get no physical injuries 

I don't need to do any change to parkour.

# Progress
## Learn one tutorial
At the beginning of the class, everyone was offered a tutorial link[Tutorial link](https://www.example.com), which could be relavent to our topic. I picked a tutorial about bouldering at the beginning. But later I switched to skateboarding so I could not use the experience from this tutorial.


## First Unity Project - Animal collecting coins
Two month after first lecture I followed one tutorial on Youtube([Bird collect coins](https://www.example.com)) to build my first unity project.

## Run the parkour/Set up VR

## Troubles
I met following new bee problems at the very beginning of my project.
Mac can not load. It has to be windows system. 
The cabel of meta quest is
