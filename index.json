[{"content":"I felt so energetic today. I have to admit that I didn't not work today. After today's daily meeting, my colleague A chatted me that he was still busy setting up his new laptop but he would let me know when he finished so he could give me the new task. In addition, I checked the master branch too, it hasn't been updated by O yet. Okay I was kind of free today. Two colleagues who are kind of responsible for me will take a two-weeks and three-weeks vacation this month. I guess I could only ask for the posiibility of becoming werkstudent when they come back.\nI had a call with my old friend Sisi in China for one hour. She was one grade higher than me in my bachelor's university and we worked for the Competition Department in our college together but she was in charge of me. As for Competition Department, it is actually part of Students' Union. We convey detailed information of all kinds of competetions to all the students from our department, organize competetions, collect materia of participants. There is one annual competetion we hold every year, which is similar as ACM ICPC(International Collegiate Programming Contest) but not as large as it. Though we invite lots of teams (usually around 200 people in total) from colleges and universities in Hangzhou. It was so much fun organizing this event since every year I played a different role in it. I can talk so much about it but I would stop talking about it for now. Sisi is also my good friend and we did lots of things together, such as riding bikes at night from Qianjiang river to West Lake, sleeping in the office overnight, helping her to move out student dormitory\u0026hellip;I couldn't remember now. She gave me suggestions on studying and life. I always came to her when I felt upset. We were so close that I was doubting myself for a while that if I were a lesbian (joking haha) We shared each other about our life right now. She was a C++ developer but now she is working as a product manager.\nAfter the call with her, I called my family. It has been two months since I had a video call with them. They are all fine but it was kind of sad to know that my neighbor's grandma died of covid last December. I still remember meeting this lovely grandma walking with her daughter-in-law by the riverside near my home in the evening. But she died at over 90 years old. We call it 'a celebration of new life' in Chinese. It could be translated more directly into 'joyful funeral'. The family sold their house to another neighbor and moved into a newly built apartment near us. I felt so strange that I haven't been home for two years and I will have new neighbor. But actually I know the family of new neighbor. The father is a physics teacher from my high school and he taught my cousin and one friend of mine as well. He sit next to me when I was eating at my grandpa's funeral. His son is an army pilot maybe two or three years older than me, which is like a pround of my high school and my hometown but he is barely at home according to my dad. \u0026quot;They are adding a lift in the building and it is quite loud\u0026quot;, my dad complained. LOL\nFinally comes to the part of girls' night! I met Kexin, Shuyuan, Yiwen at Yiwen\u0026rsquo;s place. We had an appointment to eat together after they finish their exams. According to my memeory, I knew Shuyuan from Chinese social media platform 'Weibo' (Chinese version twitter or X) when I was still in China (maybe in 2020 I'm not so sure). I posted some information about applying for TU Darmstadt and she dm me later since she was interested in TU Darmstadt as well. She is still at her second semester in IT Sicherheit major. But she was already in Germany at that time. She had a adorkable american shorthair cat named \u0026quot;dog dog\u0026quot; with her. She spent around 1200 Euro to bring it from China to here.\nI met Kexin in my second semester, we chose the same course \u0026quot;IT Sicherheit\u0026quot;. She was the first Chinese girl I knew that we study the exact same major here. I was excited. After knowing each other, we found some mutual friends as well. We prepared three or four exams together last year this time. Both of us took more than 10 exams at that time, which made us kind of \u0026quot;legend\u0026quot; in our friend group. One night before the exam of \u0026quot;IT Sicherheit\u0026quot;, we inspired each other and studied at PC room in S2|02, luckily we passed with one 4.0 and one 3.7. :\u0026gt;\nYiwen is the type of friend that we can enjoy delicious meal together but not do sports together. She is so good at cooking that we always persuade her to open up a Chinese restaurant. Thanks to her recipe I posted one dish in Little Red Book and I got 139 likes. Because we live so close to each other, I come to her place very often. We have each other\u0026rsquo;s contact number for a long time since we registered at the same time. But it was not until collecting free second stuff in Karlshof that we met each other. We talked so much about study near my building whild holding the free plate? glass? we collected from generous person. She met lots of my friends too. She has been studied so much about computer nerwork these days that she said her friend group was the subnet of mine. LOL\nWe mainly talked about our family, study, past experience tonight. What a coincidence is that we all come from one-child family in China. We had no brothers or sisters when we grew up.\n","permalink":"https://yccyangchen.github.io/posts/life/girlsnight/","summary":"I felt so energetic today.

Am Morgen met ich eine Kolligin N von mir in Frankfurt Hbf.\nI'm exhausted today because I did work 8 hours in office today. During this 8 hours, I attended 3 meetings, contacted with 7 colleagues(online and offline, working and eating). I was CC for 14 times! But the real number of the Emails that I needed to check is only 4. I can tell my colleagues had a busy day today, since today is kind of important for release preparation but some of responsible persons are on holiday this month. There was one email literally saying(based on my understanding), come on someone please check this issue, the team we are cooperating is hard to handle\u0026hellip;\nMy weekly routine on my offline workday is always eatting a toast as breakingfast at McDonald. However I ate Müsli with milk at home today. Unexpectedly I met one of my colleague N when I was on my way to office in Frankfurt Hbf. I was hesitated to say hello to her since I don't have so much contact with her at work. But I still caught up with her and talked a bit, asked how was her apartment hunting as she mentioned it last time during our lunchtime together. Later on our way to the building we met another colleague of us, O, grabbing a cup of coffee in his hand. O is my first technical mentor in the company, he guided my with my first task. As he was talking about his TÜV examination we arrived at our building.\nG gave me my last task about sql. I haven't figured out how to export large number from dataframe to excel in normal number form. They have changed into scientific notation in excel automatically. He suggested me to add one more column as text format. Then he will have a two-weeks holiday to New Swanstone Castle. Therefore I need to turn to another colleague A for my next task. A will talk to me on Thurday. A is a frontend developer, I guess my task will have something to do with frontend again but maybe in java I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure.\nMy first thing to do in the morning was running the regressiontest so my other colleagues can discuss the result in the afternoon. I was kind of proud of myself that I made some small achievements. But it turned out that there were some duplicated results due to data source code, which I need to check tomorrow again. First I will wait for my colleague O to update the master branch and create a new feature branch for me. Then I will add or delete some datasource code. All in all, the result of test was fine.\nI ate with 5 colleagues today at kasino. (The website of our menu for kasino had been 404 for a long time!) We talked about holiday plan, Ferienhaus and driver license. What did they prepare for the holiday, like bikes, wander shoes, blabla\u0026hellip; I was focus on eating bcs I usually was the last one to finish my food but today I was not.\n","permalink":"https://yccyangchen.github.io/posts/life/0908/","summary":"Ich bin erschöft heute, da arbeitete ich ganz Tag 8 Stunden im Büro.
