[{"content":"\rBackground/Motivation I have attended the kickoff course of IVAR in 2022. It was the most interesting lecture I have ever attended. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any experience about unity at that time so I was thinking I could attend this course next year after I got some experience with unity. However, I still didn\u0026rsquo;t try to learn unity. So here I am. There are two purposes of taking this course:\nfollowing the course schedule sysmatically to finish a project find an interesting topic for my master thesis. The goal of the course is to create locomotion technique and implement interaction task in a parkour map in XR environment with meta quest.\nThe Idea After the first lecture every attendee was required to write a short motivation email to the tutor. Because the number of equiments is limited, the number of students who can attend this lecture is also limited.\nI was thinking about all the different sports I have tried before, such as bouldering, rowing, shooting. But later I decided to implement skateboarding experience. The reasons are as follows:\nthe people without skateboarding experience before can try to skateboard as well. people get no physical injuries I don\u0026rsquo;t need to do any change to parkour.\nProgress Learn one tutorial At the beginning of the class, everyone was offered a tutorial link, which could be relavent to our topic. I picked a tutorial about bouldering at the beginning. But later I switched to skateboarding so I could not use the experience from this tutorial.\nFirst Unity Project - Animal collecting coins Two month after first lecture I followed one tutorial on Youtube(Bird collect coins) to build my first unity project.\nRun the parkour/Set up VR Github link(parkour)\nTroubles I met following new bee problems at the very beginning of my project.\nMac can not load. It has to be windows system. The cabel of meta quest is short. How to fine tuning the rotation of the skateboard. What interaction movement can I think for t-shape task? The movement on the slope Code retrieves the horizontal input from the primary thumbstick and assigns this input to the variable steerAngle, which is used to control the rotation of the skateboard.\ndetermines how fast the skateboard rotates in response to the thumbstick input.\nfloat steerAngle = OVRInput.Get(OVRInput.Axis2D.PrimaryThumbstick).x; currentSkateboardAngle += steerAngle * Time.deltaTime * rotationSpeed; skateboard.rotation = Quaternion.identity; skateboard.Rotate(skateboard.right, slopeAngle, Space.World); skateboard.Rotate(skateboard.up, currentSkateboardAngle,Space.World); handle input from the right trigger button on a VR controller to simulate a sliding motion and calculate the slide velocity based on the magnitude of the offset vector divided by the time it took to move (Time.deltaTime).

I have to admit that I didn't work today. After today's daily meeting, my colleague，A chatted me. He mentioned that he was still busy setting up his new laptop but assured me he would let me know when he finished so he could assign me a new task. Additionally, I checked the master branch; it hasn't been updated by O yet. So, I had some free time today. Two colleagues who are somewhat responsible for me will be on a two-week and three-week vacation this month. I suppose I can inquire about the posiibility of becoming a working student when they return.\nI had a one-hour call with my old friend Sisi in China. She was one grade higher than me at my bachelor's university, and we both worked in the Competition Department at our college, with her being in charge of me. The Competition Department is actually part of the Students' Union. Our role involved conveying detailed information about various competetions to all the students from our department, organizing competetions, and collecting materials from participants. One annual event we hold is similar to the ACM ICPC(International Collegiate Programming Contest), although not as large in scale. We invite numerous teams, usually totaling around 200 people from colleges and universities in Hangzhou. Organizing this event was incredibly enjoyable, as I played a different role each year. While I could elaborate on this endlessly, I'll pause here for now. Sisi is also a close friend of mine, and we've shared countless experiences together, such as riding bikes at night from Qianjiang River to West Lake, spending nights in the office, and helping her move out of her student dormitory - I can't remember all of them. She provided me advices on both studying and life, and I often turned to her when feeling upset. Our bond was so strong that, jokingly, I even wondered if I might be a lesbian at one point. We confided in each other about our current lives. She used to work as a C++ developer but now serves as a product manager.\nAfter the call with Sisi, I reached out to my family. It had been two months since I last had a video call with them. They are all doing well but it was quite sad to learn that my neighbor's grandmother died of COVID last December. I still remember encountering this lovely grandma walking by the riverside near my home in the evening, accompanied by her daughter-in-law. She passed away at over 90 years old. In Chinese culture, we refer to this as a 'celebration of new life', which could be more directly translated as a 'joyful funeral'. The family sold their house to another neighbor and moved into a newly built apartment close to us. I felt a sense of strangeness, realizing that I haven't been home for two years and I'll have new neighbors. However, I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with the family of the new neighbors. The father is a physics teacher from my high school, and he also taught my cousin and a friend of mine. He even sat next to me during my grandpa's funeral. His son is an army pilot, perhaps two or three years older than me, and serves as a source of pride for both my high school and hometown. Unfortunately, he's barely at home, according to my dad. \u0026quot;They are installing an elevator in the building, and it\u0026rsquo;s quite noisy\u0026quot;, my dad complained. LOL\nFinally, it\u0026rsquo;s time for the girls' night! I met up with Kexin, Shuyuan, Yiwen at Yiwen\u0026rsquo;s place. We had planned to get together for a meal after they finished their exams. As far as I remember, I got to know Shuyuan through the Chinese social media platform 'Weibo' (which is similar to the Chinese version of Twitter or X) when I was still in China (probably around 2020 although I'm not entirely certain). I had posted some information about applying to TU Darmstadt, and she dm me later since she was also interested in the university. At that time she was already in Germany. She is now at her second semester in IT Security major. She had an adorkable American shorthair cat named \u0026quot;dog dog\u0026quot;(transliterated as \u0026quot;go go\u0026quot;) with her, which she brought all the way from China to Germany at a cost of around 1200 Euros.\nI met Kexin during my second semester when we both chose the same course \u0026quot;IT Sicherheit\u0026quot;. She was the first Chinese girl I knew who was studying the exact same major here, and I was really excited. As we got to know each other, we also discovered that we had some mutual friends. Last year, around this time, we teamed up to prepare for three or four exams together. At that point, both of us were taking more than 10 exams, which earned us a kind of \u0026quot;legendary\u0026quot; status within our friend group. On the night before the \u0026quot;IT Sicherheit\u0026quot; exam, we motivated and supported each other while studying in the PC room in S2|02. Fortunately, we passed with grades of 4.0 and 3.7. :\u0026gt;\nYiwen is the kind of friend with whom I can enjoy a delicious meal, but we don't really do sports together. She's so skilled at cooking that we often tease her about opening a Chinese restaurant. Thanks to a recipe of hers that I shared on Little Red Book and I got 139 likes. Because we live so close to each other, I visit her place frequently. We've had each other's contact numbers for a long time, as we registered at the same time. However, it wasn't until we were collecting free items in Karlshof that we actually met. While holding the free plate or glass we had collected from a generous person, we engaged in a conversation about our studies near my building. She\u0026rsquo;s met many of my friends as well. She\u0026rsquo;s been diving so deep into studying computer network recently that she humorously claimed her friend group was a subnet of mine. LOL\nTonight, our conversation mainly revolved around our families, studies, and past experiences. Interestingly, we all come from one-child families in China – what a coincidence. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have any brothers or sisters while growing up.\nI had planned to add the 'comment' feature today but I was feeling tired. Now people can comment under every post, but I intended to add one comment board as archive.\n","permalink":"https://yccyangchen.github.io/posts/life/girlsnight/","summary":"I felt so energetic today.

I was hesitated to say hello to her since I don't have so much contact with her at work. But I still caught up with her and talked a bit, asked how was her apartment hunting as she mentioned it last time during our lunchtime together. Later on our way to the building we met another colleague of us, O, grabbing a cup of coffee in his hand. O is my first technical mentor in the company, he guided my with my first task. As he was talking about his TÜV examination we arrived at our building.\nG gave me my last task about sql. I haven't figured out how to export large number from dataframe to excel in normal number form. They have changed into scientific notation in excel automatically. He suggested me to add one more column as text format. Then he will have a two-weeks holiday to New Swanstone Castle. Therefore I need to turn to another colleague A for my next task. A will talk to me on Thurday. A is a frontend developer, I guess my task will have something to do with frontend again but maybe in java I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure.\nMy first thing to do in the morning was running the regressiontest so my other colleagues can discuss the result in the afternoon. I was kind of proud of myself that I made some small achievements. But it turned out that there were some duplicated results due to data source code, which I need to check tomorrow again. First I will wait for my colleague O to update the master branch and create a new feature branch for me. Then I will add or delete some datasource code. All in all, the result of test was fine.\nI ate with 5 colleagues today at kasino. (The website of our menu for kasino had been 404 for a long time!)
